# GuessingNumber
This project is a guessing number game built from react native using expo cli
<br>
## Installation
Expo CLI is a command line app that is the main interface between a developer and Expo tools. Expo CLI also has a web-based GUI that pops up in your web browser when you start your project â€” you can use the GUI instead of the command line interface if you're not yet comfortable using a terminal or prefer GUIs, both have similar capabilities.
<br>
As this project is built on `expo-cli` and not on `react-native-cli`,hence we first need to install the environment:
To install the environment, type the following command on the terminal:
<br>
`npm install --global expo-cli`
<br>
